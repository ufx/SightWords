# Sight Words
This is a web app I wrote many years ago to help my daughter learn sight words.  It's designed to run on the parent's phone with the child reading next to them.  The parent controls the app.

# Features
- Word lists through second grade, plus the alphabet.
- Words are displayed as large as possible.
- Minimal distracting animations, colors and buttons to help direct focus.
- Randomly generated focus list of 10 words that always show first.
- After the focus list, alternately displays sets of 5 known words followed by 5 unknown words.
- Progress tracker for known words.
- Responsive and loads quickly.
- No advertisements or data collection.

# Usage
- Tap the star on the bottom to move known words to the end of the list.
- The star can be removed if a word is forgotten.
- Tap the right of the screen to move to the next word.
- Tap the left of the screen to go back.
- Refresh or reopen the page to randomize the list of words.
- Progress is automatically saved in your browser.
- Tap the grade level in the upper left corner to switch grade levels.
- Save a bookmark to your homescreen to remove distracting browser buttons.
